## Script Generation - Simpsons Series

In this project, we try to train a word level language model using RNN on Simpsons Series.This project was done as part of Neural Network Foundations Nanodegree program at Udacity. 

The Jupyter notebook with standard rnn model can be found [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Character-RNN/Character-RNN.ipynb).
